          <p>
            At Astana Wellness Center, we understand the importance of
            cardiovascular health and are dedicated to providing comprehensive
            care for individuals with heart and vascular conditions. Our
            Comprehensive Cardiovascular Care program offers a wide range of
            services aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and treating
            cardiovascular diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team of cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, nurses, and
            support staff work together to deliver personalized care tailored to
            each patient's unique needs. Whether you are seeking preventive
            services, diagnostic testing, or advanced treatment options, we are
            committed to helping you achieve optimal heart health and overall
            well-being.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Services Include:</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Preventive Cardiology:</strong> Our preventive cardiology
            program focuses on identifying and managing risk factors for
            cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, high
            cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. We provide personalized
            risk assessments, lifestyle counseling, and preventive interventions
            to help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Diagnostic Testing:</strong> We offer a comprehensive range
            of diagnostic tests and imaging studies to evaluate heart and
            vascular function, including electrocardiography (ECG),
            echocardiography, stress testing, cardiac catheterization, CT
            angiography, and MRI scans. These tests help us diagnose heart
            conditions accurately and develop individualized treatment plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Interventional Cardiology:</strong> Our interventional
            cardiology team performs minimally invasive procedures to treat
            coronary artery disease, heart valve disorders, and peripheral
            vascular disease. Procedures include coronary angioplasty and
            stenting, transcatheter valve replacement, and peripheral artery
            interventions. These advanced techniques offer less pain, shorter
            recovery times, and improved outcomes compared to traditional
            open-heart surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cardiac Surgery:</strong> For patients requiring surgical
            intervention, our cardiovascular surgeons specialize in a wide range
            of procedures, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),
            heart valve repair or replacement, atrial fibrillation surgery, and
            aortic aneurysm repair. Our state-of-the-art operating rooms and
            experienced surgical teams ensure the highest quality of care and
            outcomes for our patients.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Heart Failure Management:</strong> Our heart failure program
            offers comprehensive care for patients with heart failure, including
            medical management, lifestyle modifications, device therapy (such as
            pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators), and heart
            transplantation evaluation and coordination. Our goal is to optimize
            quality of life and improve outcomes for patients living with heart
            failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cardiac Rehabilitation:</strong> Our cardiac rehabilitation
            program provides supervised exercise training, education, and
            support for patients recovering from heart surgery or experiencing
            cardiovascular conditions. Our multidisciplinary team helps patients
            regain strength, improve cardiovascular fitness, and adopt
            heart-healthy lifestyles to prevent future cardiac events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Vascular Surgery:</strong> Our vascular surgeons specialize
            in treating conditions affecting the arteries and veins, including
            peripheral artery disease, carotid artery disease, abdominal aortic
            aneurysms, and venous disorders. We offer minimally invasive
            endovascular procedures as well as open surgical techniques to
            restore blood flow and prevent complications associated with
            vascular disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Electrophysiology:</strong> Our electrophysiology program
            focuses on diagnosing and treating heart rhythm disorders
            (arrhythmias) using advanced mapping and ablation techniques,
            implantable cardiac devices (such as pacemakers and defibrillators),
            and cardiac resynchronization therapy. Our electrophysiologists
            specialize in managing complex arrhythmias and offer innovative
            treatment options to improve heart rhythm control and quality of
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cardiovascular Research:</strong> As a leading academic
            medical center, we are actively involved in cardiovascular research
            and innovation. Our research programs aim to advance the
            understanding of heart and vascular diseases, develop new treatment
            strategies, and improve outcomes for patients. We participate in
            clinical trials and collaborate with national and international
            partners to translate scientific discoveries into clinical practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you are seeking preventive care, diagnostic evaluation, or
            advanced treatment options for cardiovascular conditions, our team
            is here to provide compassionate care and support every step of the
            way. Your heart health is our top priority, and we are committed to
            helping you achieve a healthier, happier life.
